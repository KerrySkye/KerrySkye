        <h1>My name is Kerry</h1>
        <p>I am a 22 year old mom to four large fur children. I love traveling and exploring new things. The colors I chose for this page remind me of my favorite place in the country - the Pacific Northwest. I do think the background color is a little much right now, but as more information gets added it will blend well. I am taking an Intro to Web and Programming class because it is needed for my degree, but I am finding it a lot more interesting than I expected. I am not confident I know what I want to do yet and this class has introduced me to a new possible career path.</p>
