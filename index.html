        <h1>My name is Kerry</h1>
        <p>I am a 22 year old mom to 3 dogs and a very annoyed cat. I love traveling and exploring new things. The colors I chose for this page feel very Pacific North-West and I love it. I am taking an Intro to Web and Programming class because it is needed for my degree, but I am finding it a lot more interesting than I expected. This class has introduced me to a new possible career path.</p>
