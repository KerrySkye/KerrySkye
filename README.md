## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kerry Knepley and this account is linked to my school email ksknepley@my.waketech.edu. My Github account is an assignment for my CTI-110 Web and Programming class. This is my main repository to save my Github code. To clone this repository onto my local machine, I downloaded Github Desktop, selected the "+" icon, selected "Clone a repository," and chose this repository: KerrySkye.github.io. I then chose to clone the repository into my WakeTech/CTI-110/GitHub folder.
